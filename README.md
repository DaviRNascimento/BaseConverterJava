# BaseConverterJava
A Base Converter...with Java! 

I coded this program in 2 days, not in their entirely, but I spent a lot of time paying attention to all the details and trying to troubleshoot all the exceptions and inputErrors...
I'm sure there are yet some problems and a lot of upgrades that can be added, and I'll do that, considering Java is my favorite programming language;

I choosed a differente approach, separating into two files, or better, two java classes and inside of the Main class I just called the other class methods. I dont know if this is the best 
approach, but I wanted to challenge myself managing two different classes;

If you find some issue, tell me! the biggest problem I had to fix in this code was inside the last method, to return the conversions...I did not know that was necessary to use BigIinteger
to return the 'F' of hexadecimal values as a hexadecimal value, indeed. But I learned and I'm sure it's going to be useful;
