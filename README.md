# BaseConverterJava
A Base Converter...with Java! 

I coded this program in 2 days, not in their entirely, but I spent a lot of time paying attention to all the details and trying to troubleshoot all the exceptions and inputErrors...
I'm sure there are yet some problems and a lot of upgrades that can be added, and I'll do that, considering Java is my favorite programming language;

I choosed a differente approach, separating into two files, or better, two java classes and inside of the Main class I just called the other class methods. I dont know if this is the best 
approach, but I wanted to challenge myself managing two different classes;

If you find some issue, tell me!
